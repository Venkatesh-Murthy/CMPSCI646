reference to those who have con</line><line>trolled the world's thought in the past. And thus the</line><line>names of great men become a part of the elemental</line><line>power of language itself. Shakespeare's works touch</line><line>our life and mind at all points, and he is himself be</line><line>hind most of our critical perceptions. He illumines</line><line>our atmosphere, and the prismatic lights and shadows</line><line>that he casts through each generation are moving and</line><line>transitory things.

At</line><line>Athens and at Rome all parties had a religious belief</line><line>in the power of criticism.

It will be seen that I</line><line>began these studies by a paper on the plays as poetry,</line><line>for it is as poetry that Shakespeare first approaches</line><line>most of us. Nevertheless, the drama, and the bones</line><line>of dramatic construction, the management of plot,</line><line>the arts of speech and rhetoric, are always at play in</line><line>him. They are the wings of his vehicle. And thus</line><line>the actual stage becomes the true place to study him.</line><line>The footlights are our best guide to him ; and if he</line><line>should be lost to the living stage, a great part of his</line><line>meaning would vanish. It is for this reason that the</line><line>reader will find in these Notes various discussions of</line><line>the plays as mere shows, as popular amusements, and</line><line>much scattered talk about acting, enunciation, and</line><line>even about children's performances.</line></section></region></page><page w="1878" h="3100" id="12" key="12" label="PT_CHAPTER" refid="ref_page_0012" pageNumber="I-3"><region><section id="0" key="742" label="SEC_BODY"><line>II</line></section></region><region><section id="0" key="743" label="SEC_BODY"><line>THE PLAYS AS POETRY</line></section></region><region><section id="0" key="744" label="SEC_BODY"><line>IT is strange to think that the greatest and most</line><line>enduring things in literature have been written for</line><line>festivals and holiday amusements, or as the pastimes</line><line>of leisure. Of this nature were the Greek dramas and</line><line>the earliest epic poems ; of this nature were the medi</line><line>aeval romances, Moliere's plays, Calderon's plays</line><line>whatever is greatest in drama, whatever is most eter</line><line>nal in fiction.

The charm is everywhere in him</line><line>in a phrase, in a speech, in a climax, or in the mood</line><line>that lies behind them all. His wit, humor, and unex</line><line>pected leaps and plunges of thought are held to</line><line>gether by a thread of narrative which is never</line><line>broken, but which tugs at us and focuses our atten</line><line>tion on the action. The thread of the story is often</line><line>the only dramatic unity to be found in a play of</line><line>Shakespeare.</line></section></region><region><section id="0" key="748" label="SEC_BODY"><line>Whatever playwrights may claim or scholars pro</line><line>pound, the mass of mankind reads for recreation, and</line><line>it is as an engaging writer of fiction that Shake</line><line>speare has made his way. The taste for stories is</line><line>eternal. In the Homeric Age the tales were recited</line><line>by a bard ; in the Middle Age, by a jongleur in a</line><line>castle yard. In Elizabeth's day they were sung by</line><line>ballad-mongers, until the primitive stage caught</line><line>them up, and a new generation of poets turned the</line><line>tales of the world into dramas. The passion behind</line><line>all this popular literature, from Homer to Kipling,</line><line>is a passion for fiction. The form changes from</line><line>poetry to prose and back again, the subjects vary</line><line>with the taste of the times ; but the inner meaning</line><line>and inner value of all these forms of literature is the</line><line>same at all epochs it is recreation through fiction.</line></section></region><region><section id="0" key="749" label="SEC_BODY"><line>Shakespeare has held his place in the world through</line><line>competition with subsequent fiction.

Every shade of emotion that flits</line><line>through the heart of a character is reduced to a</line><line>thought ; and thus the rapidly moving story is accom</line><line>panied by a cloud or nimbus of running commentary,</line><line>gay or gloomy, poetic or worldly-wise according to</line><line>circumstance, but always metaphysical, always</line><line>Shakespeare.</line></section></region><region><section id="0" key="752" label="SEC_BODY"><line>These side-lights and explanations in Shakespeare</line><line>are really the remarks of the narrator himself, but</line><line>he has so colored them to suit each character and so</line><line>woven them into the action, that they pass as mere</line><line>gestures and do not dog the story too closely. They</line><line>expound it, illuminate it, keep it alive. When the</line><line>average man reads one of the plays for the first time,</line><line>he wants to know what is going to happen. When he</line><line>has satisfied this curiosity he becomes ensnared in the</line><line>wit, wisdom, and beauty of the piece.
